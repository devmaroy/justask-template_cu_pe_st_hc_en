JustAsk Discussion Platform
=======================

Personal discussion platform project. Based on flexbox layout, html5 and modern css3 principes with a little bit of php.

This project is used as a little demonstration of my skills and for evolving my knowledge as a full stack web developer.

You can modify and use this project or certain components if you wish.

For any questions feel free to contact me at me@mwardew.com <br />
