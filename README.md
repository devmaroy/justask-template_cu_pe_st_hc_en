## ðŸŽ‰ Quick Start

1.  **Clone from Github.**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:devmaroy/justask_template.git
    ```

  <br />


## ðŸ¤” What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in my Gatsby project.

    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ favicon
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
    â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ screenshot.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ yarn.lock
    â””â”€â”€ README.md

<br />

1.  **`/favicon`**: This directory contains favicon files.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the neccessary files such as scss styles and js.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for project. **(You wonâ€™t change this file directly).**

5.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the projectâ€™s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for project.

6.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about project.
